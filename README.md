I'm a college student passionate about turning **data into decisions** and building tools that actually *do* something.  
From analyzing trends to deploying full-stack data apps, I love the whole process.

- 🛠️ Tech stack: `Python`, `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `Streamlit`, `Flask`, `SQL`, `Git`, `Docker` , `Tensorflow/Keras`,  
- 📈 Love making: dashboards, prediction models, and hackathon-ready tools  
- 💬 Ask me about: stock market analysis, EDA, model evaluation, and scraping strategies
